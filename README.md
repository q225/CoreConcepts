This Repo is simply a crisp and clear understanding of concepts which we genrally use in our world of software Engineering.

So in this repo, I am just creating the code in c++ or probably java to implement in the easiest way.

I don't know everything, but I know few thing.

It is going to be maintained by me, andif you want to contribute to the codebase you can simply raise a PR.

Want to learn and share both.
